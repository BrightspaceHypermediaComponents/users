polymer serve
```

```shell
npm run lint
```

To run unit tests locally using [Polymer test](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#tests):

## Versioning & Releasing

All version changes should obey [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

Releases use the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) tooling and the [angular preset](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular) for commit message syntax. Upon release, the version in `package.json` is updated and a tag and GitHub release is created.

Commits prefixed with `feat` will trigger a minor release, while `fix` or `perf` will trigger a patch release. A commit containing `BREAKING CHANGE` will cause a major release to occur.

Other useful prefixes that will not trigger a release: `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style` and `test`. More details in the [Angular Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).
